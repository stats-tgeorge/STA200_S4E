## Waypoint Project Description: 

It is widely recognized that individuals exiting the judicial system often face significant barriers to stable housing, employment, and successful reintegration into society. To address these challenges, Waypoint launched the Homeless Diversion Program in partnership with the 6th Judicial District. This initiative aims to reduce the risk of homelessness and break the cycle of recidivism by connecting justice-involved individuals with housing and essential stabilizing resources.

The program uses a collaborative, housing-first approach that supports reentry by securing stable housing as a foundation for rebuilding. Stable housing enables participants to pursue employment, access treatment and other support services, reconnect with family, and reduce the likelihood of reoffending—all while easing the burden on probation officers.

Throughout the pilot phase, the program’s impact became especially evident, as participants encountered significant housing barriers that required intensive advocacy and relationship-building with landlords. Many of these landlords may not have otherwise considered renting to individuals with histories of manufacturing or sex offense charges, particularly those subject to residential restrictions. The program played a critical role in opening these housing opportunities and supporting long-term stability.

We will be seeking answers to key questions about this program! 


## Initial Course Description:

This course will examine factors impacting Iowans' engagement with Waypoints services. The course will include (1) learning the descriptive statistics needed to investigate data, (2) communicating with Waypoint representatives to establish straightforward research questions, learning what data need to be collected and how to access various databases, (3) completing the analysis of their data, and (4) present your findings. We may go off-campus to present our findings to Waypoint and participate in other relevant activities. Everybody must sign a confidentiality agreement to participate in this course, as we will be working with private data.
