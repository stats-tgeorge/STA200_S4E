### Definition

A **data dictionary** is a table that describes the variables in a dataset: their names, what they mean, what type of data they are, and any special notes. Data dictionaries help you (and others!) understand your dataset clearly and avoid mistakes in analysis.

In this activity, you will create a data dictionary for the dataset provided.


1. Create a table in Word.

Open a blank Word document and insert a table with the following four columns:

| Variable | Description | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
|          |             |      |       |

**Column definitions:**

- **Variable**: the exact column name from the dataset.  
- **Description**: a short explanation, in plain language, of what the variable means.  
- **Type**: the kind of data (numeric, categorical and what kind of each).  
- **Notes**: anything extra that would help someone understand or use the data (units, coding scheme, missing values, etc.).

2. Fill in the table.

4. Put your table in its own word document. Save it as its own file with name **WaypointHDP_DataDictionary.docx** and then upload it to your group Google Drive folder. 

5. Extra.
- Open your current data. 
- Re-save your file with name **WaypointHDP_Data_Group(give group number)**. 
- Delete the tab CE Contact tab. 
- Save.
- Upload clean data to your group folder.
