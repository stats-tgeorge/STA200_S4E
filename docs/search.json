Create a table below with the variables as columns and the individuals as rows. For the the five clients who are listed on the whiteboard, fill in your table. Each group member needs to complete 1 entry.\n\nOnce complete this short activity, I would like your group to start planning whys we can use this data to investigate inequities we have been discussing in class. We will soon cover some statistics but start considering how you will summarize and visualize this information in a way that will informative, meaningful, and easily understandable to the public. I encourage you to also look for examples online and include them in a document shared in your group folder. Make sure to cite your sources."

    "text": "Waypoint Services has tasked us to investigate a community service to help houseless people, specifically a program for people who have been incarcerated recently. Let’s start by understanding inequity in housing.\nGoogle Drive: As part of the first activity, please create a shared Google Drive folder for your group this block and upload your .docx file to that folder. Once uploaded, you will all be able to work on that document at the same time.\nRoles: In this activity, you will all be responsible for conducting searches and reviewing items found. Generally, you will all have assigned roles, but in this case, you should all be working on the shared document, adding different items as explained below. Please choose a facilitator.\nNames____________________________________________________________________________________________\nFacilitator (make sure everybody is given space to share regularly)______________________________\n\nNo External Research for this question. In your group, I would like you to discuss among yourselves how you would define inequity. Write a one-sentence definition.\nNow you can start to use the internet. Each group member should spend a few minutes looking for different definitions of inequity and examples. Each group member should select a different example. Consider looking for something you have a personal connection to or have thought about before. Include your examples below (make sure to cite your sources; websites are fine in this case).\nNow, as a group, decide on a single example of inequity. Give your definition below.\n\nStop for class discussion.\n\nNow that you have a definition for inequity, you can start to look for it in Iowa. In groups, please look for some anecdotal evidence. We are explicitly looking for inequity in Iowa and how it relates to having a home.\nBegin by discussing with your group how you will search: what keywords will you use? What do you consider are your likely sources? What is a quality source? How will you know if your search is thorough enough? There have been two natural disasters in Iowa in the last 20 years, a flood and a derecho, both of which destroyed many homes. Consider these events when conducting your search.\nCollect all of your search results into your shared document as you go along. Make sure you are taking notes on each source so you remember why you included it. (Make sure to cite your sources; websites URLs are fine in this case.)\nExample of notes: “www.example.///.” shows a video of those most affected by the derecho and features a person of color who is now homeless. They discuss how most of the people in that neighborhood are individuals of color.\nAim for at least 5 to 10 examples. You have a group for good reason.\nCreate a presentation to be presented today on your findings (3min-5min). Use your examples to tell a story. You can use PowerPoint or other visualizing software. Make your presentation compelling, and feel free to show off some of the most meaningful examples. All students must present some of their findings."

    "text": "You will be working with the data we cultivate in conjunction with Waypoint and Iowa Legal Aid. The goal of this project is for you to work with this data, use descriptive statistics to investigate the following research questions:\n\nFor those who have completed the waypoint program, is there a relationship between the race and/or gender of the individuals and evictions?\nFor those who have completed the waypoint program, is there a relationship between the race and/or gender of the individuals and who successfully completes a program?\nIs there a relationship between the race and/or gender of the individuals and who uses, and reuses housing programs?\n\nThe goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather to visualize the data in a presentable, interpretative way to a public audience, potentially including young children. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed in your groups.\nThe project is very open ended. You should conduct an investigation of the data, investigate variables, and searching for insights. You should also create at least one very compelling visualization to can be used to shed light on your research question.\nSome ideas:\n\nBrochure\nComics\nChildren’s Book\nPoster/infographic\nVideo/tik tok\n\n\nDeliverables and Due Dates\n\nMid Block Presentation - Due Friday September 8th at 10am\nPresent Mid Block Presentation - Friday September 8th\nAnalysis report - Due Thursday September 14th at 11:59 pm via Moodle.\nIn progress final visual with presentation - Tentatively Due Friday September 15th at 2pm\nFinal visual - Tentatively Due Monday September 18th at 3pm\nSYS Showcase - Tuesday September 19th\nFinal Presentation to Waypoint - Wednesday September 20th\n\n\n\nMid-Block Presentation\nDue to the time it takes to do our data collection, this first presentation is more of an update for our partner, Waypoint. We will meet via Zoom; find the zoom link on our Google Calendar. I would like your group to include the following.\n\nPresentation Contents\nIncluding all of the items in your presentation. Use Google Slides saved in your group folder. Export the slides as PDF and submit them to Moodle immediately following the presentation Friday September 8th. I am asking your group to present for about 8-15 minutes total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n50 pts\n\n\n\n\nDescribe your project goals, in your groups words. Include the formal research questions.\n5 pts\n\n\nDiscuss the data collection your groups has been doing and the challenges involved. Consider the notes you have taken and different situations your group had to consider when recording data.\n15 pts\n\n\nGive a data analysis plan. What types of tables and graphs will be useful given the variables we will have available and research questions?\n10 pts\n\n\nDiscuss what form you want your final project to take (some examples above).\n10 pts\n\n\nOrganization of Presentation\n10 pts\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation\nI am asking your group to present for about 8-15 minutes total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n50 pts\n\n\n\n\nTime management: Did the team divide the time well among themselves or got cut off going over time?\n15 pts\n\n\nProfessionalism: How well did the team present? Does the presentation appear to be well practiced?\n15 pts\n\n\nTeamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like independent pieces of work patched together?\n10 pts\n\n\nFlow: Did the presentation move in a linear fashion outlining your projected process in a logical order.\n10 pts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Report\nThe report is written toward your professor (not a general audience). It’s purpose is to organize and detail all of your analysis you would like to use in your final product. Thus, if you decide a particular visualization is not useful don’t include it.\n\n1. Title\nGive an informative title to your project.\nAssessment: Does the title give an accurate preview of what the paper is about? Is it informative, specific and precise?\n\n\n2. Background and significance\nIn this section you are providing the background of the project area and arguing why it is interesting and significant. This section relies heavily on literature review (prior research done in this area and facts that argue why the research is important). This whole section should provide the necessary background leading up to your presentation. Well-accepted facts and/or referenced statements should serve as the majority of content of this section. Typically, the background and significance section starts very broad and moves towards the specific topic your group is presenting on.\nAssessment:\n- Does the background and significance have a logical organization? Does it move from the general to the specific?\n- Has a reasonable explanation been given for why the research was done? Why is the work important? Why is it relevant?\n- Does this section end with statements about the hypothesis/goals of the work?\n\n\n3. Methods\n\nData collection. Explain how the data was collected and where it is from. Who is it about?\nVariables and variable creation. Detail the variables in your analysis and how they are defined (if necessary). For example, if your group, or your professor, created new variables based on the raw data, or summaizes data, you make sure to define the new variables. Consider how some of the variables were collected by Waypoint or others and include that in your definitions.\nAnalytic Methods. Explain the statistical procedures that will be used to analyze your data. E.g. Boxplots are used to xxx and are created by xxx. You are not giving your results yet but giving textbook like explanations of all methods used.\n\nAssessment:\n\nCould the study be repeated based on the information given here?\nIs the material organized into logical categories (like the one’s above)?\n\n\n\n4. Results\nTypically, results sections start with descriptive statistics, e.g. what percent of the sample is each gender, what is the mean number of evictions overall, in the different groups, etc. Figures can be nice to illustrate these differences! However, information presented must be relevant in helping to answer the research question(s) of interest.\nTables and figures should be labeled, embedded in the text, and referenced appropriately. The results section typically makes for fairly dry reading. It does not explain the impact of findings, it merely highlights and reports statistical information.\nAssessment:\n\nIs the content appropriate for a results section? Is there a clear description of the results?\nAre the results/data analyzed well? Given the data in each figure/table is the interpretation accurate and logical? Is the analysis of the data thorough (anything ignored?)\nAre the figures/tables appropriate for the data being discussed? Are the figure legends and titles clear and concise?\n\n\n\n5. Discussion/Conclusions\nRestate your objective and draw connections between your analyses and objective. In other words, how did (or didn’t) you answer/address your objective. Place these all in the larger scope of previous research on your topic (i.e. what you found from the literature review), that is, how do your findings help the field move forward? Talk about the limitations of your findings and possible areas for future research to better investigate your research question. End with a concluding sentence or two that summarizes your key findings and impact on the field.\nAssessment:\n\nDo the authors clearly state whether the results answer the questions?\nWere specific data cited from the results to support each interpretation? Does the author clearly articulate the basis for supporting or rejecting each hypothesis?\nDoes the author adequately relate the results of the current work to previous research?\n\n\n\n6. References\nUse a standard such as APA or Chicago style for your references. Be consistent.\nAssessment:\n\nAre the references appropriate and of adequate quality?\nAre the references cited properly (both in the text and at the end of the paper)?\n\n\n\n7. Technical Quality\nClarity, organization, and writing quality (typos, grammar).\nCredit: The Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n200 pts\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n10 pts\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n40 pts\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n40 pts\n\n\n\nResults\n\n40 pts\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\n30 pts\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n20 pts\n\n\n\nTechnical Quality\n\n20 pts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual\n\nFinal Visual - In Progress\nYou and your group will present your ongoing project visual to your professor.

Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a visual that is interpretable to a general audience.\n80%-89% - Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, and communicates most results clearly to others in interpretable visual.\n70%-79% - Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69% - Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60% - Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n\n\nTeam peer evaluation\nYou are to complete the assignment as a team. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged, by their teammates, to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all analysis was completed. You will be asked to fill out a survey where you report a contribution percentage for each team member. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than 20% of the work, please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that they did less than 10% of the work, this person will receive half the grade of the rest of the group."
