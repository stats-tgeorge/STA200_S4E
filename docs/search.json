This type of fluctuation is part of almost any data-generating process.\nThe observed difference between the two groups (70 − 19 = 51%) may be real, or may be due to natural variation.\nSince the difference is quite large, it is more believable that the difference is real.\nWe need statistical tools to determine if the difference is so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance."

While some smokers seemed to be sensitive to cigarette smoke, others were completely unaffected.\nAnti-smoking research was faced with resistance based on anecdotal evidence such as:\n“My uncle smokes three packs a day and he’s in perfectly good health.”\nThis evidence was based on a limited sample size that might not be representative.\nIt was concluded that “smoking is a complex human behavior, by its nature difficult to study, confounded by human variability.”\nIn time researchers were able to examine larger samples of cases, and trends showing smoking’s negative health impacts became much clearer.\n\n\n\nBrandt, The Cigarette Century (2009), Basic Books."

    "text": "It is widely recognized that individuals exiting the judicial system often face significant barriers to stable housing, employment, and successful reintegration into society. To address these challenges, Waypoint launched the Homeless Diversion Program in partnership with the 6th Judicial District.

    "text": "Waypoint Project Description\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is widely recognized that individuals exiting the judicial system often face significant barriers to stable housing, employment, and successful reintegration into society. To address these challenges, Waypoint launched the Homeless Diversion Program in partnership with the 6th Judicial District. This initiative aims to reduce the risk of homelessness and break the cycle of recidivism by connecting justice-involved individuals with housing and essential stabilizing resources.\nThe program uses a collaborative, housing-first approach that supports reentry by securing stable housing as a foundation for rebuilding. Stable housing enables participants to pursue employment, access treatment and other support services, reconnect with family, and reduce the likelihood of reoffending—all while easing the burden on probation officers.\nThroughout the pilot phase, the program’s impact became especially evident, as participants encountered significant housing barriers that required intensive advocacy and relationship-building with landlords. Many of these landlords may not have otherwise considered renting to individuals with histories of manufacturing or sex offense charges, particularly those subject to residential restrictions. The program played a critical role in opening these housing opportunities and supporting long-term stability.",

Does the presentation appear to be well practiced?\n15 pts\n\n\nTeamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like independent pieces of work patched together?\n10 pts\n\n\nFlow: Did the presentation move in a linear fashion outlining your projected process in a logical order.\n10 pts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Report\nThe report is written toward your professor (not a general audience). It’s purpose is to organize and detail all of your analysis you would like to use in your final product. Thus, if you decide a particular visualization is not useful don’t include it.\n\n1. Title\nGive an informative title to your project.\nAssessment: Does the title give an accurate preview of what the paper is about? Is it informative, specific and precise?\n\n\n2. Background and significance\nIn this section you are providing the background of the project area and arguing why it is interesting and significant. This section relies heavily on literature review (prior research done in this area and facts that argue why the research is important). This whole section should provide the necessary background leading up to your presentation. Well-accepted facts and/or referenced statements should serve as the majority of content of this section. Typically, the background and significance section starts very broad and moves towards the specific topic your group is presenting on.\nAssessment:\n- Does the background and significance have a logical organization? Does it move from the general to the specific?\n- Has a reasonable explanation been given for why the research was done? Why is the work important? Why is it relevant?\n- Does this section end with statements about the hypothesis/goals of the work?\n\n\n3. Methods\n\nData collection. Explain how the data was collected and where it is from. Who is it about?\nVariables and variable creation. Detail the variables in your analysis and how they are defined (if necessary). For example, if your group, or your professor, created new variables based on the raw data, or summaizes data, you make sure to define the new variables. Consider how some of the variables were collected by Waypoint or others and include that in your definitions.\nAnalytic Methods. Explain the statistical procedures that will be used to analyze your data. E.g. Boxplots are used to xxx and are created by xxx. You are not giving your results yet but giving textbook like explanations of all methods used.\n\nAssessment:\n\nCould the study be repeated based on the information given here?\nIs the material organized into logical categories (like the one’s above)?\n\n\n\n4. Results\nTypically, results sections start with descriptive statistics, e.g. what percent of the sample is each gender, what is the mean number of evictions overall, in the different groups, etc. Figures can be nice to illustrate these differences! However, information presented must be relevant in helping to answer the research question(s) of interest.\nTables and figures should be labeled, embedded in the text, and referenced appropriately. The results section typically makes for fairly dry reading. It does not explain the impact of findings, it merely highlights and reports statistical information.\nAssessment:\n\nIs the content appropriate for a results section? Is there a clear description of the results?\nAre the results/data analyzed well? Given the data in each figure/table is the interpretation accurate and logical? Is the analysis of the data thorough (anything ignored?)\nAre the figures/tables appropriate for the data being discussed? Are the figure legends and titles clear and concise?\n\n\n\n5. Discussion/Conclusions\nRestate your objective and draw connections between your analyses and objective. In other words, how did (or didn’t) you answer/address your objective. Place these all in the larger scope of previous research on your topic (i.e. what you found from the literature review), that is, how do your findings help the field move forward? Talk about the limitations of your findings and possible areas for future research to better investigate your research question. End with a concluding sentence or two that summarizes your key findings and impact on the field.\nAssessment:\n\nDo the authors clearly state whether the results answer the questions?\nWere specific data cited from the results to support each interpretation? Does the author clearly articulate the basis for supporting or rejecting each hypothesis?\nDoes the author adequately relate the results of the current work to previous research?\n\n\n\n6. References\nUse a standard such as APA or Chicago style for your references. Be consistent.\nAssessment:\n\nAre the references appropriate and of adequate quality?\nAre the references cited properly (both in the text and at the end of the paper)?\n\n\n\n7. Technical Quality\nClarity, organization, and writing quality (typos, grammar).\nCredit: The Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition\n\n\n\nEarly-Submission of Analysis Reports\nAt first submission, you should have all components of the report included; however, your paper may not be as polished. I will evaluate you across the same areas, but the total points are 50. Generally, I will be more forgiving and leave comments, but not always take off points during the first submission round.

Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a visual that is interpretable to a general audience.\n80%-89% - Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, and communicates most results clearly to others in interpretable visual.\n70%-79% - Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69% - Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60% - Student is not making a sufficient effort.\n\n\n\nTeam peer evaluation\nYou are to complete the assignment as a team. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged, by their teammates, to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all analysis was completed. You will be asked to fill out a survey where you report a contribution percentage for each team member. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than 20% of the work, please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that they did less than 10% of the work, this person will receive half the grade of the rest of the group.",
